Across the desert plains
Where nothing dares to grow
I taught you how to sing
You taught me everything I know
And thought the night is young
And we don't know if we'll live to see the sun
The best is yet to come
I know, you know
That we've only just begun
Through the highs and lows
And how can I live without you
You're such a part of me
And you've always been the one
Keeping me forever young
And the best is yet to come
Hey ah eh oh
Don't look now, the best is yet to come
Hey ah eh oh
Take my hand, the best is yet to come
